Known BUGS in Games::Bingo (and issues)

Alpha

 -  Plate.pm line 120 dies once in a while because the handling of the 
	collection is not working as expected.

	my $number = $c->get_number();

	FIXED
	
 -  The sort of the column does apparently not work or maybe I use it the 
    wrong way
    
    FIXED
 
 -  The plate population algoritm seems to have a flaw in that sense that if 
    we end up with a situation where we have to populate the last row with 
    two numbers from the same series, the plate will lack a number or two.
    
    FIXED (work-around implemented)

0.01

 -  Long lines in the text files (README, INSTALL etc) should probably be 
    wrapped down to 72 chars or so, to increase readability.
    
    [cpan #2552] <URL: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2552 >
    
    FIXED
 
 -  http://rt.cpan.org and bug-Games-Bingo@rt.cpan.org should be mentioned as
    bug reporting interface.

    [cpan #2553] <URL: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2553 >

	DONE
    
 -  The modules have no abstract (In NAME, one usually puts 
 	"Module::Name - Module that does something)
 	
 	DONE
 
 -  Prototypes should be removed
 
    Prototypes are used for methods. That's useless, since they're ignored for 
    runtime thingies. Besides that, have a look at: 
    "Far More Than Everything You've Ever Wanted to Know about Prototypes in Perl"
    
    <http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/fmproto.html >
    
    DONE
   
 -  Some POD is broken otherwise (if you use multiple angle brackets, you must 
    also use whitespace!)

	CLEANED OUT
    
 -  Games::Bingo::Print POD is not browsable at CPAN, it is broken.
 
 	*** ERROR: =over on line 172 without closing =back (at head2) at line 174 in file 
 	lib/Games/Bingo/Print.pm

	FIXED

0.02

 -  POD is =cut and then immediately continued... (from Juerd use.perl.org)
 
0.03
 
 -  Games::Bingo::Print POD is not browsable at CPAN, it is still broken.
