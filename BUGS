 -  Plate.pm line 120 dies once in a while because the handling of the 
	collection is not working as expected.

	my $number = $c->get_number();

	FIXED
	
 -  The sort of the column does apparently not work or maybe I use it the 
    wrong way
    
    FIXED
 
 -  The plate population algoritm seems to have a flaw in that sense that if 
    we end up with a situation where we have to populate the last row with 
    two numbers from the same series, the plate will lack a number or two.
    
    FIXED (work-around implemented)
