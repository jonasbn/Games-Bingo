TODO for Games::Bingo

$Id: TODO,v 1.13 2003/05/16 10:28:43 jonasbn Exp $

- Separate Games::Bingo into Games::Bingo and Games::Bingo::Print
  modules

- The generated PDF could use some fine-tuning

- Restructurize tests for easier identification

- Write tests for the _integrity_check method in
  Games::Bingo::Print::Plate

- Alter Games::Bingo::Print so the number of plates on a page is a
  parameter, requires plates are drawn top-dows (see below)

- Write a Tk front-end

- Implement checksums on plates, necessary for making an online game

- Generate plates top-down instead of bottom up

- Implement suggested Games::Bingo::Bot (suggested by djberg96 on
  use.perl.org)

- Rename plates to cards? (which is the true english word for a bingo
  plate, heh)
  
- Rename take to pull perhaps? - I am not really into the bingo terms in 
  english.

- Add generation of master plate (all numbers) on paper for the referee?
  (see bin/bingo.pl)
