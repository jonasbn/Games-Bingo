TODO for Games::Bingo

$Id: TODO 1864 2007-08-08 09:12:37Z jonasbn $

- Improve coverage see perldoc Games::Bingo

- Add logging of game sessions (Log::Log4perl)?

- Add cheat to Games::Bingo::play method, we need to be able to control
  what number is picked, both for test purposes and for fun, computer games
  SHOULD have cheats

- Write a Tk front-end?

- Implement checksums on cards? - necessary for making an online game

- Write a Windows .NET front-end?

- Check requirements, module version numbers not specified. I suspect the 
  problems with t/Cover.t was due to differences in Test::More versions?

- Implement test of new constructor

- Implement and use G::B::Card::Generation::Algorithms

  Since Kim Hansen have sent me an alternative card generation
  algorithm, I plan to change the architecture so one can pick an alternative
  algorithm (choosing between my scheme and Kim Hansens scheme or your own)
  
  I am referring to the algorithms as G::B::Algorithm::Card::Generation
  
  ::Random

  for my own and Kim Hansens as
  
  ::Distributed
  
  my own will be default. So a serious refactoring is coming up.

- Rewrite complete test suite so each sub will have its own test file

- Implement Games::Bingo::Tournament
