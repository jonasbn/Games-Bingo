TODO for Games::Bingo

$Id: TODO,v 1.22 2003/08/18 08:34:43 jonasbn Exp $

- Write a Tk front-end?

- Implement checksums on cards? - necessary for making an online game
  
- Add cover test of Games::Bingo (see t/Cover.t), Devel::Cover does not
  run under 5.6.0 (Perl >5.6.0)

- Write a Windows .NET front-end?

- Check requirements, module version numbers not specified. I suspect the 
  problems with t/Cover.t was due to differences in Test::More versions?
