TODO for Games::Bingo

$Id: TODO,v 1.26 2003/12/27 13:27:06 jonasbn Exp $

- Write a Tk front-end?

- Implement checksums on cards? - necessary for making an online game
  
- Add cover test of Games::Bingo (see t/Cover.t), Devel::Cover does not
  run under 5.6.0 (Perl >5.6.0)

- Write a Windows .NET front-end?

- Check requirements, module version numbers not specified. I suspect the 
  problems with t/Cover.t was due to differences in Test::More versions?

- Implement test of new constructor

- Since Kim Hansen have sent me an alternative card generation
  algorithm, I plan to change the architecture so one can pick an alternative
  algorithm (choosing between my scheme and Kim Hansens scheme or your own)
  
  I am referring to the algorithms as G::B::Algorithm::Card::Generation
  
  ::Random

  for my own and Kim Hansens as
  
  ::Distributed
  
  my own will be default. So a serious refactoring is coming up.

- Implement and use G::B::Card::Generation::Algorithms

- Add algorithm from Kim Hansen (see bullets above)

- Rewrite complete test suite so each sub will have its own test file

- Implementent Games::Bingo::Tournament

- Add get_label method to G::B::Column

- Add count_columns method to G::B::ColumnCollection (proper encapsulation)
