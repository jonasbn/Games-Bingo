0.14 2007.08.08 (Update not necessary)

- NB! a minor API change, the splitnumber method has moved from
  Games::Bingo::Card to Games::Bingo

- Updated Build.PL to more contemporary version

- Added scripts statement to Build.PL, to avoid problems with auto
  generated Makefile.PL, when this is enabled in Build.PL

- Due to problems with coverage testing, module coverage showing up as
  n/a for some of the core classes I decided to clean up the code a bit.
  Coverage now works and the problem seemed to be circular usage of
  modules, more details on the cleaning below

- I have refactored Games::Bingo so it no longer inherits from
  Games::Bingo::Card

- Method splitnumber has moved from Games::Bingo::Card to Games::Bingo
  test t/card_splitnumber.t removed and introduced new test

0.12 2004.01.31 (Update not necessary)

- According to my fellow Copenhagen Perl Monger Kim Hansen, the actual
  number of numbers in a bingo card is 15 not 12, so I have update
