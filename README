README for Games::Bingo

This collection of modules and programs comes from when I got the idea
that I had never programed a bingo game for my computer. I got inpired
by playing and actual physical bingo game and I though to myself -
that's easy to implement and yes it was.

But now the project has grown, and the next natural step was to make the
progam able to print its own bingo plates, Matt Saergant suggested using
PDFLib.

Well not even having the PDF part in place I got the crazy idea of
implementing an Aqua GUI for the program, which would give the code a
nice separation having both a console version and a GUI version.

Anyway - have fun
