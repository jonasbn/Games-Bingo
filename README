README for Games::Bingo

This collection of modules and programs comes from when I got the idea that I had never programed a bingo game for my computer. I got inpired by playing and actual physical bingo game and I though to myself - that's easy to implement and yes it was.

But now the project has grown, and the next natural step was to make the progam able to print its own bingo plates, Matt Saergant suggested using PDFLib.

Well not even having the PDF part in place I got the crazy idea of implementing an Aqua GUI for the program, which would give the code a nice separation having both a console version and a GUI version.

Anyway - have fun
