README for Games::Bingo

This collection of modules and programs comes from when I got the idea
that I had never programed a bingo game for my computer. I got inpired
by playing and actual physical bingo game and I though to myself -
that's easy to implement and yes it was.

in the bin directory is located a simple console based bingo game
application called bingo.pl

But since the project has grown, and the next natural step was to make
the progam able to print its own bingo plates, Matt Saergant suggested
using PDFLib and for providing me with an working example.

in the bin directory is also located a plate printing console
application called bingo_plates.pl

Well not even having the PDF part in place I got the crazy idea of
implementing an Aqua GUI for the program, which would give the code a
nice separation having both a console version and a GUI version.

This can be downloaded from my homepage:

http://usr.bin.dk/~jonasbn/osx/CamelBingo.tgz

It is a CamelBones based OSX application, for now it is just a GUI
version of the console game and it is still under development.

Anyway - have fun

BTW If you experience any bugs please report them using:
